    <!-- create an ordered list with any questions you have on this week's material -->
    <ol>
      <li>When you console.log has text followed by a number variable, the text is black, but when you precede text with a number variable, the text is red. How come? Is it noteworthy?</li>
      <li>I made two for loops [for(let i=0; i<=array.length; i++)], but only one of them worked correctly. The second of the two loops I was summing the values within the array, but still unclear how it was erroring.  I resolved it by getting rid of the = sign within middle parameter ie [i less than array.length] </li>
    </ol>
